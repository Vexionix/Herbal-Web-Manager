# Herbal Web Manager (HeMa)

Project done by Perju Mircea-Stefan and Hulubei-Tudor (A4) for Web Technologies. The project represents a web page that revolves around plants. For now functionalities and our views are TBD as we just started but we will keep updating as we go on.

# Current objectives

- Implement the design of the home, about, help, contact, sign up and login pages
- Talk about the way we want to go about the project and task sharing
- Setup a proper working space with a few standards, such as dividing in branches and talking about our merge requests to make sure we know what the other person is doing.
