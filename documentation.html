        <h2>1.4 Product Scope</h2>
        <p>Our goals is to unite the herbal community in a place that feels like home. The website is meant to be seen

        <h1>2. Overall Description</h1>

        <h2>2.1 Product Perspective</h2>
        <p>
            The website is still in a very incipient state, but our view about it is that it will be place where herbal
            enthusiasts can come to and share their passion about plants. The variety and collections will unite users
            and
            will separate our application from the rest.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our goals are to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Offer users a simple to use and yet attractive interface that works well both on desktop and mobile.
            </li>
            <li>Be fully funcitioning on modern Web browsers.</li>
            <li>
                Be customizable for inclusion in arbitrary Web sites, while remaining easy to process
                and interoperable.
            </li>
            <li>Fix errors and bugs promptly and keep collaborating as a team.</li>
            <li>Long-term viability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2.2 Product Functions</h2>
        <p>
            Users benefit of a multi-criteria search feature that allows them to explore the website more efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
            There will also be a leaderboard displaying the most collected plants.
        </p>
        <p>
            There will be an option for users to export data as CSV and PDF.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users can contact us to express their opinions and feedback on the website and report bugs as well in a form
            that
            can be found on the <a href="contact.html">contact</a> page.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to gain access to all functionalities, users must use the sign up and login functions as logging in
            provides the users with the aforementioned features.
        </p>
        <h3>Structure</h3>
        <p>
            The website is built (for now) only on HTML and CSS. We are still in talks about deciding what we will use
            forward
            in order to fulfill our goals. We might use JavaScript for the front-end and Python/PHP (we are not sure
            about
            this yet) for the back-end.
        </p>
        <p>The application consists of:
        <ul>
            <li>Home Component</li>
            <li>About Component</li>
            <li>Help Component</li>
            <li>Contact Component</li>
            <li>Sign up Component</li>
            <li>Login Component</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>2.3 User Classes and Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            The website is intended for herbal enthusiasts that want to share their passion with others, as it was
            mentioned
            before. The users can be divided in: hobbyists, professionals, students, teachers, biological researchers
            etc.
        </p>

        <h2>2.4 Operating Environment</h2>
        <p>
            For now the website runs locally, but maybe at some point we will consider hosting. The application runs on
            various browsers and devices.
        </p>

        <h2>2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h2>
        <p>
            Due to the fact that we are still learning the concepts of web development, we struggled to implement some
            features that we wanted properly, and as such we had to make some compromises. We tried to cover
            responsiveness as
            much as possible as well. Due to timing constraints, there are some features that we can't implement, such
            as
            restructuring the html and css files in order to follow BEM methodology. We also couldn't tackle the use of
            SCSS.
            We are aware of an issue with the <a href="index.html">Home</a> page not properly adjusting to the screen
            size and
            are still actively working on a fix (will update in case there was one done), but the rest of the pages are
            responsive on all devices. Only problems that can appear are on really low width resolutions (below 200px),
            but
            realistically no device uses that, the lowest we could find was the Fold phone at ~200px.
        </p>

        <h2>2.6 User Documentations</h2>
        <p>
            Users can navigate to <a href="help.html">Help</a> page to get relevant insight on how to use the
            application.
        </p>

        <h2>2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies</h2>
        <p>
            We assume that even though the site is structured this way now, with the implementation of the future
            functionalities, the structure is going to change, design included. We plan to add user-related features,
            such as
            tracking as who you are logged in as, and what you have done on the site, but that's for the future.

        <h1>3. External Interface Requirements</h1>
        <h2>3.1 User Interfaces</h2>
        <p>
            The website shares the same header and footer on each page. The whole idea is to present a green enviroment
            in
            order to make the user feel like they are in a garden. For the header "logo" we used the font "The Bold
            Font".
            Every element is created with the idea to be easy to use and to be user-friendly, as well as pleasing the
            eye.
        </p>

        <h2>3.2 Hardware Interfaces</h2>

        </p>

        <h2>3.4 Communication Interface</h2>
        <p>
            Through the contact form the user can send an email to the admins of the website. The form is simple and
            easy to
            use and fill, as well as useful in terms of providing the administration the information needed to improve
            the QoL
            of the users.

        <p>
            We will implement an account management system and the user will be treated differently whether they are

            or not. The user will have the ability to sign up and login, as well as to sign out.
        </p>


        <h2>4.2 Multi-Criteria Search System</h2>
        <p>
            There will be a multi-criteria search system that will allow the user to search for plants based on multiple
            criteria. The user will be able to search for different type of plants such as medicinal ones, mountain
            flowers
            etc. The search system will generate, recommend and share thematic albums that contain the plants.
        </p>

        <h2>4.3 Statistics Export System</h2>
        <p>
            We will make it so certain statistics can be exported as CSV and PDF. The user will be able to export the
            statistics of the plants in their collection.
        </p>

        <h2>4.4 Leaderboards</h2>
        <p>
            The most collected plants will be displayed in a leaderboard.

        <h2>5.3 Security Requirements</h2>
        <p>
            The website will be secure and the user's data is protected. The website will use HTTPS to encrypt the data
            sent
            between the user's device and the server. The website will also be protected against common security threats
            such
            as SQL injection and cross-site scripting. This are our plans, we'll see how much we can implement regarding
            security.
