                    <p>Welcome to our website! Most features are only available to registered users. If you are new here
                        head to <a href="signup">Sign up</a> in order to register, otherwise you can <a
                            href="login">login</a> here. If you want to find out more about us you can do so by heading
                        to the <a href="about">About</a> page. Functionalities for users are still to be added, but you
                        will also be able to search for plants by filtering specific fields, so keep an eye out for this
                        in
                        the future!</p>
                    <p>
                        If you encounter a problem on our website, we would appreciate it if you would fill out the form
                        found in the <a href="contact">Contact</a> tab. The site is still in a very incipient state and
                        as such there might be a lot of bugs/unimplemented features for now.

                    <p>
                        If the post got removed it was probably due to the fact that it was either a duplicate or it was
                        not a plant. We are trying to keep the database as clean as possible and as such we are removing
                        any posts that do not fit the criteria. If you think that the post was removed by mistake,
                        please contact one of the admins.
